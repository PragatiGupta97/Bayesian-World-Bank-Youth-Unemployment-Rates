# Bayesian_Data_Analysis_QSAR_Toxicity
This project we predicted the Aquatic Toxicity of the QSAR Dataset using Bayesian Inference. 
Programming language R was used along with Stan for modelling.
Here we focus on Bayesian inference with MCMC. Bayesian inference gives us a principled quantification of uncertainty and the ability to incorporate domain knowledge in the form of priors, while
MCMC which is a reliable and flexible algorithm. In addition, Stan provides diagnostic tools to evaluate both the inference (e.g. accuracy of the MCMC, convergence of chains) and the model (e.g. posterior predictive checks).

We have implemeted the following sections in our R markdown. 
1. Introduction
2. Description of the data and the analysis problem
3. Description of the 3 models used 
4. Informative or weakly informative priors 
5. Stan code
6. How the Stan model was run
7. Convergence diagnostics 
8. Posterior predictive checks
9. Model comparison
10. Predictive performance assessment
11. Sensitivity analysis
12. Discussion of issues and potential improvements.
13. Conclusion 

# How to run this project
1. Clone the folder QSAR to your environment. I used Rstudio on Jupyter Hub. You can chose any environment of your choice.
2. Get Stan environment ready.
3. Thats it folks! You are ready to work on the project.
